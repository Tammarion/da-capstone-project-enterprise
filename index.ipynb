    "## Analysis Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "During the data exploration phase, the datatypes of columns should be checked, the distribution of the target variable should be inspected, null values should be either removed or replaced, and duplicates (in most cases) should be dropped. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create a Baseline Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate how a simple linear regression model is understanding the dependent variable, you will begin by first creating a model that predicts the mean of the dependent variable for every observation. Predicting the mean of your target variable/feature can be considered a highly naive model. If a simple linear regression model performs worse than this naive approach, you can safely say that it is not a very good model. The same can be said of multiple linear regression models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interpret a Correlation Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a simple linear regression model, you will identify the independent variable that is most correlated with our dependent variable. To do this this you will plot a correlation heatmap to identify the variable most correlated with your target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Build a Simple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, create a linear regression model where the most correlated feature is used as the independent variable and the dependent variable is properly set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Interpret the Simple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model has been fit, the coefficient for our independent variable, its p-value, and the coefficient confidence interval should be interpeted. You should ask yourself whether or not the relationship your model is finding seems plausible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Evaluate the Simple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can make a final assessment of our model, you need to compare its metrics with the baseline model created in step one, and you need to check the assumptions of linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Build a Multiple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, create a multiple linear regression model by adding at least one feature to the model beyond the most correlated one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Interpret this Multiple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpret the coefficients for our independent variables, their p-values, and the coefficient confidence intervals. As before, you should ask yourself whether or not the relationship your model is finding seems plausible. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Evaluate the Multiple Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the metrics with the baseline model created in step one and the similar linear regression model in step four.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Decide on how next to proceed\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore other multiple linear regression models with a variety of features. Use inferential statistics and your business understanding to talk about reasons for including particular features and compare your final model back to the (1) baseline, (2) simple linear regression, and (3) initial multiple linear regression model built in step seven.\n",
